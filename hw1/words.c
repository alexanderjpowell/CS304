/*
In a file named words.c, write a program that counts the number of words in the line typed by the user, 
defined as the number of sequences of non-space characters â€” or, equivalently, 
the number of times a non-space character is preceded either by a space or by the beginning of the line. 
Here are some sample inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Input	Output
hello world	2
hello   world	2
4 words - right?	4
